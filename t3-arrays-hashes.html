    Array is series of values. Values could be numbers, strings, and etc. For example, an array of planets would look like
    planet = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    Array of numbers would look llike
    arr = [3, 5, 13, 7, 6]
    </p>
    <p>
    Array could be created by variable = Array.new(some_array). 
    </p>
    <p>
    Hash is similar to array. Hash has series of key to value pairs. For example, if I would like to create hash regarding singers and song titles, it would look like
    </p>
    <p>
    hash = {
    "Led Zeppelin" => "Whole Lotta Love",
    "Billy Joel" => "Piano Man"
    }
    </p>
    <p>
    Hash could be created by using my_hash = Hash.new
