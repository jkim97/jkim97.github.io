      I remember being extremely stressed out during my college year. The tension was caused among my younger brother and my parents. When my younger brother as in Korea, he was viewed as one of the most talented and smart students in the school. He not only had brain, but also ambition and competitive streaks. Both my parents and younger brother were happy with each other. However, things changed drastically when he discovered his love for music. It was during high school, when he started to learn how to play guitar by himself. He had natural talent for playing guitar and writing music. He played music with his friends, and hanging out with friends further developed into forming a band.

    <p>
      Things were not that bad until my younger brother started to play music at the club. It was not the club itself that upset my parents, but his constant lying and coming home past curfew.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not know what to do at that time. I could understand my brother's yearning for music, but at the same time I understood my parents' reason. Everyone complained about one another to me. I listened to their complains and concerns with very serious attitude, but in the end I was very distressed because of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have been very first time I experienced major conflict among people around me. At that time, hatred toward myself was at its' peak, so I often blamed myself for every little conflict that happened among my brother and my parents. I especially regretted coming back to the States; because I came back to the States, my family came here one by one. I thought if I never came back to the Staes, my younger brother would not have discoverd his passion for music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I know it was not my fault that my younger brother and parents' relationship strained. I was very silly thing to blame myself. However, at that time, I felt range of emotion from depression to anger. The strongest emotion I felt at that time was self-hatred. I did not know how to express my emotion or opinion to other people, so I tend to keep all my emotion within myself. I put effort to understand other people's stance, yet I refused to look after myself. I truely did not handle the situation very well. Only time helped to resolve some of the conflict among my younger brother and parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know better way to handle such a situation. Though, if I experiece similar conflict in the future, I would like to not take all the conlict to myself. For things that cannot be solved by myself, I should sometimes let everything go and wait until everything calms down.
