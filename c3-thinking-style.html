    According to the test, my thought process is close to CONCRETE SEQUENTIAL and CONCRETE RANDOM. Those two types seem to be quite contrary to each other. However, I could agree to some of the descriptions of both of them. I like clear instruction to work with, but I absolutely hate formality and limits. I want some sense of order, but I abhor restriction. I am aware of my very contradicting personality. Though, I do not care of any competition at all. I tend to focus on my work and myself, so do not really care for getting better than other people.

    I think my way of reading texts and practicing on simple things at Codecadey first, then working with DevBootcamp's challenge helps me to learn. Also, making so many mistakes then finding solution by re-reading texts and googling helps me in so many way. Making mistakes helps me to find out which part that I did not understand. I could try several different methods and going through multiple trials and errors to see where I am going.

    My biggest struggle was caused by my tendency to work on my own. When I work on challenges, I tend to get too focused. When I cannot solve the problem, I try too hard to find solution. I solve the problem at the end, but it takes a lot of time. If I asked for help, I might have been able to solve the problems much quickly. When I start working on theses things, I always say to myself 'I am going to ask for help if I face problem.'  It never happened because I always get too focused on my own works. I will try to remind myself to get a help from my peers and phase-0 staffs in the future. Maybe having multiple working stations such as github, sublime, google+ and many other is not helpful to me. I mostly look into github and my own computer, so I rarely look into google+ or any other websites.

    Although I had highest scores in CS and CR, I have pretty balanced mind style. My score for AS is 28, and AR is 24. I have very good patience to listen to other people. However, I like to keep myself and not really care about any kind of relationship with other people. I treat other people quite fairly and nicely, but I do not really care to build close relationship with other people. Putting my effort to build a relationship with other people might help me. I will try to take more interest in other people. It would help me in the future if I get a job and placed in the team.
