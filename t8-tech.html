      Internet needs both hardware and protocols to work. Two of the most important protocols could be identified as transmission control protocol (TCP) and the Internet protocol (IP); these two are often grouped together as TCP/IP. Protocol sets up rule for how information would travel. Each devices has its' own IP address. There are two types of IP address, which have been used quite often: IPv4 and IPv6. Because of rising demand of IP addresses, developers built IPv6 to meet the future needs. After transmittng information through TCP/IP protocol, program go thourgh domain name server(DNS). When it reaches to the web server, which is directed by DNS. Request will travel back to the device in the form of packet by hitting DNS and protocols.
