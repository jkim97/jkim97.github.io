  <h1><font color=#4E387E>Good Question</h1>>
  <h4>Today's Date</h4>
  <p>
  In order to write a good question, one needs to ask specific question. One needs to figure out what kind of problem she or he is facing. Then, writing the question in complete sentence is better than writing keywords.
  </p>
  <p>
  I use google for finding out solution for any struggle. I did not use complete sentence. I tried to put specific keywords, which I was looking for. I might not have used best words for question, but it worked not too bad. I think I would be able to reserach methods much better with new found knowledge. For example, when I tried to find a solution for sticking footer to botom, I typed 'footer not sticking to bottom css' instead of 'how can I stick footer to the bottom with css?'.
