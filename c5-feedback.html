    Pairing could be both beneficial yet difficult to do. Fortunately, my pairing partners so far have been very kind and patient. Though, I tend to become very nervous when pair up with someone else to solve the problem. To be honest I feel more comfortable to work alone.
    
    Most of my partners were beginners of coding just like me, so I felt a kind of comradeship. We were struggling together in order to solve the problems. Eventhough most of us are beginner, exchanging ideas and researching together to find a solution benefitted me very much. Whenever my partners and I found a solution together, we were very excited about the result.
    
    One of the best thing about paring is actually conversing about our background and our goals. There were two people, whom I was very interested in. One of them is currently residing in Taiwan. He said he wanted to get a job in Taiwan after he is finished with DevBootcamp. Coding is pretty much of universal language, so his goal to get a job in Taiwan made sense to me. I really wish he will be able to get a nice job in Taiwan. The other person has an artistic background: theater to be exact. I am a fine artist, and she was the only one among my pairing partners, who has the artistic background so far. We could relate to each other very much. Though there was difference between her and I; she wants to find a way to support other artists, but I want to pursue art till the very end of my life.
    
    
    Reading other's feedback helped me to learn how to communicate with another person. I try to be clear as much as possible, but I tend to get very obscure. They encouraged me to be more forward and voice my opinions without hesitation. Overall, many recommended me to talk more. One of them mentioned I tend to get silent when I was driving. In the future, I will try to communicate more, and explain things better whenever I am driving.
    
    Writing feedback is very difficult for me. I am good at complimenting other, but I am not very good at giving a pointer for development. I myself is not very good at conversing or interacting with people, so I rarely see anybody who has worse issue compare to me. Most of my partner so far have been quite enthusiastic and conversational. I do not see any fault in not knowing certain things because we are all beginners. Therefore, I do not feel like I am very good at giving constructive feedbacks.
    
    Overall, pairing session takes a lot of toll for me. I work during week days, so it is very stressing to make a schedule for pairing sessions. Although pairing session seems very helpful to enhance both conversational skills and techical understanding, if I have any choice I would just like to work on my won.
