    This is a simple example of using of ruby Class. I created a class called "Die". At initilize, instance variable is set up for labels. If given array is empty, it would raise an ArgumentError. Then number of the sides is measured , and set up as an instance variable. After that random side would be returned, and corresponding element would show up as an result
