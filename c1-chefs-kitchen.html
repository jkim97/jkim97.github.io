      Since it is very short and intense program, experience would be varied depending on attitude. How actively I engage with the education and my cohort could affect what kind of experience I would gain. Also, Dev Bootcamp does not separate class by student's knowledge. It is unstable and volatile environment rather than tranquil. Enthusiastic attitude would affect both other people and onself in positive direction. Impassive attitude could stress out oneself, and could affect others in negative way. To be honest, I think myself is leaning toward restaurant mindset kitchen mindset. I am curious about coding, but I am not sure if I am extremely passionate about it. It is all about first time experience and experiment. Also, I cannot deny I am expecting to gain some quality of education and to see some end result. My key for learning experience is concentration and patience rather than enthusiasm. I do not see any problem with my personality, and even though my personality is not quite fit into what Karim Bishay sees as better quality to work as a developmer, I believe my creativeness as an artist and ability to learn completely new things.
