      Since I was a child, I have been always yearning for freedom. I not only search it from outside, but also within myself. Because I feel uncertain about myself, I tend to hold my self from taking any action. I believe in order to become free, I need to let go perception and misconception of myself. Also, I would like to become free from society's value. I do not want to chase for values such as money or power. I believe people who have more self-respect tend to not get swayed by other people's words, therefore, have better attitude toward themselves and other. It is my goal to build more self-respect in order to be really free.

      On the other hand, I am always chasing for creativity. I want to create and express ideas in my mind. I want to be more open and mindful to broaden my view and idea. With my creation, I would like to influence society and positive way. I belive creativity is also a way to find a freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot say I am living up to my value yet. I am not completely free from materialistic values. It would be not easy to seek for total freedom from money and wealth, since I am living in the society that is based on capitalism; one cannot simply ignore money. I am seeking for life style, which does not concern too heavily about money or materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, I am not free from preconception of myself yet. I know having perception of oneself could stunt one's growth or possibility. Yet it is not very easy to do so. As a Buddhist, I try to let go of my emotions and thoughts in order to face myself by meditation.
