    Class method has been used for many challenges so far. It could be created by putting 'class Classname'. Within the class,  group of methods are created. By setting up variable (I usually use instance variable; it could be used by any method of the class). Then method is defined to set up what kind of behavior the program would have. Class is a great way to set up a structure. For instance, I used class method to set up bingo scorer; within the class, I set up several methods to look into horizontal, vertical, and diagonal rows of bingo board. Then method was set to see if any of those rows have bingo or not. By setting up this class, bingo board could be analyzed in every possible way to find out bingo by calling out a class method. Class method helps to create a good and clear structure.
