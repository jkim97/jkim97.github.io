    <p>
    Margin is a black space, while border is a line surrounding text. Padding is a plane which surrounds the text. 
    To select id, # needs to be written in front. For class, period needs to be written in front of the class. 
    Fixed position shows texts position relative to web browser. Relative position shows texts in relative manner from normal position. Absolute position shows text in relative manner to ancestor position.
    While inline cannot have set width and height, inline-block has set width and height. ALso, there is difference between top and bottom padding; inline-block has respect for it while inline does not have any respect for it
