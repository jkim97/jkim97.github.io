  <h1><font color=#4E387E>Stereotype</h1>
  <h4>09/07/2015</h4>
    <p>
    I believe most people are exposed to stereotype since their birth. It seems like many people have preconception for certain group of people. For example, pink is fof girls and blue is for boys.
    </p>
    <p>
    When I lived in Korea, I was ostracized by peers because I did not fit in streotype of Korean. I still do not understand how I was so different from other people, yet when I was growing up in Korea people often said 'Hey Jiyoon, you do not behave like other people. Why don't you consider studying abroad?' Eventhough I was born in the States, I mostly grew up in Korea as a child. I believe I was more influenced by Korean culture, yet many people did not view me as one of them.
    </p> 
    <p>
    One of the prejudice, which affected me a lot, is my own appearance. It seems like I look quite young to other people. In the college, my peers expected me to behave like a young child. My appearance did not impact me in negative way untill I graduated from college. When I was going for job interview, many interviewer said 'Oh, are you really a college graduate? You are much older than I thought.' They did not straightfowardly said 'Hey, I think you are irresponsible because you look like a child' but I could see what kind of prejudice was forming regarding me; I was very child like, so they were doubting if I would be able to work seriously and responsibly. After graduate, I only have been work as a part-time employee. People in the work place told me they were not taking me serious at first because of my appearance. Because of streotype based on appearance, I lost confidence in myself. I though I was more mature compare to my own age group, but now I feel like I am too. childish or immature.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is very hard to get to know a person with one interview. Yet, it is very easy to streotype a person due to one's gender, race, appearance and etc. I often heard people stereotyping people such as 'fat people are lazy' or 'Asians are good at math and science.' I do believe streotype is very serious threat because it could stunt one's growth or close one's possibility. I hope people would be able to free oneself from streotyping and free others from prejudice.
