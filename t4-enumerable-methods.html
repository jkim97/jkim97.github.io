    The map method changes every elements in blocks according to given direction. For example, if you would like to change array of strings in capitalized letters, you could write something as
    [names].map{|name| name.capitalized}
    The map method takes an enumerable object and a block, and runs the block for each element, outputting each returned value from the block (the original object is unchanged unless you use map!):
