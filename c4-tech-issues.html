  <h1><font color=#4E387E>Diversity Issue</h1>
  <h4>Today's Date</h4>
    <p>
    Tech industry lacks of diversity quite a lot. Although women's population is larger than men's in the U.S., population of women in tech companies is very small. Pandora and eBay are only two companies, where percentage of women and men's population is almost matching. In most companies, percentage of female employee does not even reach 40% of the population.
    Also, there is lack of diversity in race. Most companies hire White and Asians. Although, population of Black is much larger than Asians, numbers of Black employees in tech companies are very small. Population gap between White and others are so great, even if numbers of Black and Lation employees are all combined together it cannot reach numbers of employees of Asian nor White.
    I believe the data from "http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/" shows there is still huge discrimination for female and minor races. This is definitely a social problem. The United States is a society with very diversed group of people due to constant immigration from the very start. Though, it cannot be denied that most power to financial and political power is held by White.
    Eventhough White formed majority of the society in the past, constant immigration caused huge increase in the population of other races such as Latino and Asians. If the discrimination of race does not improve, huge social conflict will happen in the future.
    
    In order to overcome this problem, I believe more budget should be invested to education of poorer children. If DevBootcamp can teach coding to peole in eighteen to twenty weeks, why can't we teach these things to children? Higher education could be costly for people with low income. Maybe, wee could form a neat program, which could help people with less power to learn coding. In order to bridge the gap, investment to such education is needed.
